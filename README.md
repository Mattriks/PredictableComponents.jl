# PredictableComponents.jl

## Summary

*Variance* and *predictability* describe different properties of a time series.  
Principal Components Analysis finds components ordered by their variance, but  
**Predictable Components Analysis** finds components ordered by their predictability.  The first predictable component is more predictable than any other component that can be extracted from a field.

This is work in progress.  The main function `gKPrCA` finds components with maximal predictability in a linear or nonlinear sense.
